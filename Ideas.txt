Dancer Ideas
  Wander Dancers
    --Wander aimlessly around the screen, no sharp turns
    --This can be done with a current angle value, a turn speed value, and a target angle value.
    --They never travel within a certain distance of the edge of the screen

  Bouncy Dancers
    --Moves in a straight line, bouncing off the edges of the screen and other bouncy dancers
      --Maybe have them change color when they bounce?

  Gravity Bouncy Dancers
    --Like Bouncy Dancers, but with gravity that attracts them to the bottom of the screen

  Fishy Dancers
    --Like Wander Dancers, but they like to flock (school) with other Fishy Dancers of the same color
      --Could Implement FishyDancer Colors with subclasses?
      --Scared of Shark Dancers, will speed up when fleeing a shark dancer

  Shark Dancers
    --Like Fishy Dancers, but Non-shark Fishy dancers will turn away to avoid them.
    --Could also randomly or on click become "agressive" and chase the nearest fishy dancer?
      --Implement eating fish?

  Shy Dancer
    --Rapidly changes color and moves in a small area, super excitable!
      --Hovering the Shy Dancer makes it shrink, shrinks its movement range very much so that it almost vibrates, and turns it a dark grey
